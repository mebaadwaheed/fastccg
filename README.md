**FastCCG** is a simple, powerful, and developer-friendly Python library for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a clean, unified API to work with models from leading providers like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Mistral, making it easy to build, test, and deploy AI-powered applications.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔄 Unified API**: Switch between different LLM providers with minimal code changes
- **⚡ Async Support**: Built-in asynchronous operations for high-performance applications
- **🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Build powerful Q&A systems over your own documents
- **✨ Text Embedding**: Convert text into vector representations for semantic search
- **🌊 Streaming**: Real-time response streaming for interactive experiences
- **💾 Session Management**: Save and restore conversation history
- **🖥️ CLI Interface**: Powerful command-line tools for quick testing and interaction
- **🔧 Easy Configuration**: Chainable methods for clean, readable code
- **🛡️ Error Handling**: Robust error handling with custom exceptions

## 🏗️ Supported Providers

| Provider | Models | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo | ✅ Fully Supported |
| **Google** | Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash | ✅ Fully Supported |
| **Mistral** | Mistral Tiny, Small, Medium | ✅ Fully Supported |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3 Sonnet | ✅ Fully Supported |

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install fastccg
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

```python
import fastccg
from fastccg.models.gpt import gpt_4o

# Add your API key
api_key = fastccg.add_openai_key("sk-...")

# Initialize the model
model = fastccg.init_model(gpt_4o, api_key=api_key)

# Ask a question
response = model.ask("What is the best thing about Large Language Models?")
print(response.content)
```

## 🖥️ CLI Usage

FastCCG comes with a powerful CLI for quick interactions:

```bash
# List available models
fastccg models

# Ask a single question
fastccg ask "What is the capital of France?" --model gpt_4o

# Start an interactive chat session
fastccg chat --model gpt_4o
```

## 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Build a powerful question-answering system over your own documents with just a few lines of code. FastCCG handles the complexity of embedding, indexing, and context retrieval for you.

```python
import asyncio
import fastccg
from fastccg.models.gpt import gpt_4o
from fastccg.embedding.openai import text_embedding_3_small
from fastccg.rag import RAGModel

# 1. Setup API keys and models
api_key = fastccg.add_openai_key("sk-...")
llm = fastccg.init_model(gpt_4o, api_key=api_key)
embedder = text_embedding_3_small(api_key=api_key)

# 2. Create and configure the RAG model
rag = RAGModel(llm=llm, embedder=embedder)

# 3. Index your documents
documents = {
    "doc1": "The sky is blue during a clear day.",
    "doc2": "The grass in the park is typically green."
}

# 4. Ask a question related to your documents
async def main():
    response = await rag.ask_async("What color is the sky?")
    print(response.content)
    # Expected output will be based on the indexed context

asyncio.run(main())

# 5. Save your knowledge base for later use
rag.save("my_knowledge.fcvs", pretty_print=True)
```

## 🔄 Advanced Features

### Asynchronous Operations
```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Run multiple prompts concurrently
    task1 = model.ask_async("What is the speed of light?")
    task2 = model.ask_async("What is the capital of Australia?")
    
    responses = await asyncio.gather(task1, task2)
    for response in responses:
        print(response.content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Streaming Responses
```python
async def stream_example():
    async for chunk in model.ask_stream("Tell me a story"):
        print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)

asyncio.run(stream_example())
```

### Session Management
```python
# Save conversation
model.save("my_session.json")

# Load conversation later
loaded_model = fastccg.load_model("my_session.json", api_key=api_key)
```

### 🧠 Built-in Memory & Conversation Tracking

FastCCG can automatically manage conversation history for you, including persisting it for long-term use across sessions.

```python
api = fastccg.add_mock_key("akdosad")
model = fastccg.init_model(MockModel, api_key=api)

# Enable short-term (session) and long-term (file-based) memory
model.enable_memory(short_term=True, long_term=True)

# The model now remembers the context of the conversation
model.ask("Who is the president of Afghanistan?")
response = model.ask("And what was his last speech about?") # This question has context

print(response.content)
```

- **Short-Term Memory**: Keeps track of the conversation within the current Python session.
- **Long-Term Memory**: Automatically saves the conversation to a `.fcvs/memory.jsonl` file. When a new session starts with `long_term=True`, it loads the recent history, allowing the model to have context from previous interactions.
- **RAG Support**: This feature is also available on the `RAGModel`, allowing for contextual, multi-turn conversations in your RAG applications.
