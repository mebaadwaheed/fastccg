# Welcome to FastCCG

FastCCG is a Python library designed to provide a simple, unified, and powerful interface for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) from various providers.

Whether you're building a simple script, a complex application, or just want a better way to chat with different models from your terminal, FastCCG has you covered.

## Our Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Get started in minutes with a clean and intuitive API.
